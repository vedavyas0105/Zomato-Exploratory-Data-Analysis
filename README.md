# Zomato-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
**Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis**   This project analyzes the Zomato dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights into restaurant ratings, cuisine distribution, and pricing trends. The analysis helps in understanding dining patterns and business opportunities in the food industry.

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Zomato dataset to uncover insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and pricing strategies. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualize key aspects such as restaurant ratings, cuisine distribution, and price variations
- Identify business trends and insights from the data

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `zomato.csv`, which contains information about various restaurants, including:
- Name and location
- Ratings and reviews
- Cuisine types
- Pricing details
- Operational status

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and non-UTF-8 encoding issues
   - Standardized column names and data formats
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution of restaurant ratings
   - Price range comparisons across locations
   - Popular cuisines and restaurant types
3. **Visualizations & Insights**
   - Bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots for trend analysis
   - Correlation analysis between different attributes

## Key Findings
- Certain cuisines have higher average ratings than others
- Higher-priced restaurants do not always correlate with better ratings
- Specific locations have a higher density of well-rated restaurants
